# React Issues Management Application

This is a simple issues management application built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Router**, **Lucide React**, **MUI** (Material UI), and **Vite** as the development environment. This project includes a login page, a sidebar navigation, and an issues form where users can input details like priority, DC switch status, status, role assignments, etc.

## Features

- **Login Page** with email and password input, "Show Password" toggle, and "Stay Logged In" functionality.
- **Sidebar Navigation** that expands on hover and includes a theme switcher (non-functional).
- **Issues Page** where users can input various details and save them for the session (no backend, data persists only in the browser session).
- **Vite** for fast and modern development.
- **Tailwind CSS** for quick and easy styling.
- **React Router** for client-side routing.
- **Lucide React** for icons.
- **MUI** for material design components.
